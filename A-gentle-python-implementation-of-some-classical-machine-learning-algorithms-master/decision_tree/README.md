# python-implementation-of-some-classical-machine-learning-algorithms
I will implement some classical machine learning algorithms using raw python in this tutorial, including decision tree (ID3, C4.5, CART), support vector machine, logistic regression, navie bayes, k nearest neighbor, expectation maximation and adaboost.

For decision tree, I use this tutorial https://github.com/Rudo-erek/decision-tree as a guide. Thanks for Rudo-erek's contribution. For more details about decision tree, please refer to **Statistic Learning Method** by **Hang Li**. There might be some bugs in my code, since I haven't checked carefully. 

## demo code usage:
In the terminal, type:  

    python3 demo.py
